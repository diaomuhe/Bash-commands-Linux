'join' writes to standard output a line for each pair of input lines that have identical join fields.

'-1 FIELD' Join on field FIELD (a positive integer) of file 1.'-2 FIELD' Join on field FIELD (a positive integer) of file 2. '-j FIELD' Equivalent to `-1 FIELD -2 FIELD'. `-o FIELD-LIST' Otherwise, construct each output line according to the format in FIELD-LIST. Each element in FIELD-LIST is either the single character `0' or has the form M.N where the file number, M, is `1' or `2' and N is a positive field number.
